                            <p>
                                Homegames is a game platform allowing people to play games built by the Homegames community. Everything we build is free and open source with a GNU GPL v3.0 license, with the exception of our game engine <a href="https://github.com/homegamesio/squish">squish</a> which has an MIT license). Games are JavaScript components that consist of a state that can be translated to a rendered state on a Homegames client using squish. Using the Homegames platform, users can sign up for an account and publish games of their own to share with friends or publish for the world to play.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Squish (our game engine) is a common dependency between Homegames core and Homegames web. It's basically a component that translates a game from "state stored in memory on the server" to "rendered image on the screen". "State stored in memory on the server" is <a href="https://github.com/homegamesio/homegames-core">Homegames core</a>. "Rendered image on the screen" is our official <a href="https://github.com/homegamesio/homegames-web">Homegames web client</a> or any other custom client. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            As of July 2022, we don't have very thorough documentation for much of the process of game development or publishing. We have documentation for Squishjs (the Homegames game engine) available at https://github.com/homegamesio/squish which at this point is probably the best documentation we have. More documentation is coming soon, specifically around building games and the different features we support. We're planning on having a full guide on building and publishing your own game by July 30, 2022.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The TL;DR if you want to poke around is download the binaries available at https://homegames.io or download the main homegames repo at https://github.com/homegamesio/homegames, run `npm install` `npm run` `npm run build` and then go to homegames.link in a browser on any device on the same LAN as you.

                            We also have some "building stuff" videos in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9BiQ9HyAQCMAZZQ-4FH3oCLYo-8BYYly" target="_blank">this YouTube playlist</a> for more of a "watch & learn" type of content. They are also old and wrong.
