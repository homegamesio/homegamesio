                                We have the ability to publish games, but no way to show users the games published by specific developers. The goal of this feature is to have a section on the Homegames website that displays all publicly available games published by a specific developer, as well as a short (200 characters max) "about" section. This will give developers the ability to add whatever text they want, including links to their social media, donation links, etc.

                                In my opinion (this is Joseph by the way), a game isn't real if you can't play it with a gamepad. We have a skeleton of gamepad support in our current implementation of Homegames web, but I'd like to expand that to support different gamepad types and a clean interface to interact with them.

                                Searching for new games will always require an internet connection, but much of our platform can be made available offline. This entry is basically "add download buttons to games and assets to make them available when a public Internet connection is not available."

                                It would be cool if anyone in the world could join/spectate your game session. The plan here is to optionally allow sessions to be available at something like `sessions.homegames.io/sessionId` and allow users to access the server from the Internet. This would also solve the HTTPS issue, where the certificates would be handled by the Homegames server and users wouldn't need to store any certs/keys on their personal machines.

                                As of August 2021, our download process feels pretty sketchy. We use <a href="https://github.com/vercel/pkg" target="_blank">pkg</a> to build binaries which are then pushed to S3 and linked to from the Homegames build service. These binaries are not signed, so when you download them on Windows or MacOS (shout out to Linux), you get a warning telling you the thing you just downloaded is from an unidentified developer. This turns people off of the whole thing, so we need to make that process smoother. We've looked into this and apparently it just costs money? Anyway we'll figure it out.

                                Our web client currently uses the canvas API to render game nodes sent by the game server. We still need to investigate the potential benefits and downsides of using it, but we think it'd be cool to use WebGL to improve performance and enable game developers to get as much functionality as possible from the tools we provide. Once we look into this more, we'll update this roadmap.
