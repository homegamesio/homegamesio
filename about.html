                            <strong>
                                Hello! We're Joseph and Yazeed. We've been friends since 2009, and we've been building Homegames since 2018. 
                            </strong>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            We're both full-time software developers who work on Homegames in our free time. We love games and learning new stuff, and after years of experimenting and figuring out what we were trying to build, we're excited to finally launch Homegames in 2023! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The earliest version of Homegames was as a simple browser-based multiplayer game rendering demo. Over time, it eventually grew into a game engine and publishing platform allowing users to share games with their friends. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We still have quite a bit we want to do, but as of April 2023, we've built some pretty cool features such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Multiplayer games over LAN</strong> - anyone on the same wifi network as a Homegames server can play games on any browser by navigating to https://homegames.link
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Language agnostic clients</strong> - Homegames servers output game data in binary format over websockets - anything with web socket support can be a Homegames client 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>JavaScript-based game engine</strong> - support for custom images, sound assets, 2D layer rendering, device input and user interactions
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Game publishing</strong> - in addition to the games we build and provide "out of the box," users can make their own games and optionally publish them to our "catalog" making them available to the world
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Dashboard</strong> - Users can create or join game sessions from a list of installed games via the Homegames dashboard, or search for new games to download from the catalog
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We don't have any solid plans to make money from Homegames at the moment. We just wanted to build something cool that enabled others to do the same, and that eventually turned into Homegames. We want to make it easy for others to learn and build stuff they're proud of.
                        </p>
